### What did you find? Which borough is the most expensive? Any other interesting trends?
Westminster tends to have the highest increase in prices, on average, over the last two decades. I also noticed that the city of London has an upward trend in price between the year 1999 to 2019. As the year increases, the price tends to increase.

#### How did you arrive at your conclusion?
I was able to arrive at this conclusion after making a bar plot to view the top 15 cities in sales over the last two decades. Also, I made a line plot for the city of london so see the relationship between the price and the year. 

#### What were the main challenges you encountered? How did you overcome them? What could you not overcome?
The main problem I encountered was trying to find the ratio between  the year 2018 and the year 1998. I restarted my jupyter notebook and also sought help from stackoverflow to solve the problem. 

#### Is there anything youâ€™d like to investigate deeper?
I would like to investigate the relationship between price and year for other cities apart from the city of london.
